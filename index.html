          During this internship I worked with the Development, Design and Product teams to create a front end application for non-touch screens in Vue and Electron. The application features an image slider and API requests from DI's custom-built CMS. Two large screens display separate slideshows, permanently on view in Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall.

        <p class="paragraph-right">
          During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
          the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
          was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
          library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing within our automation product.
