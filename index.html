          I started collecting beads and making textiles when I was eight years
          old. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited
          internationally. Check out the site I created for my art!

          During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
          the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
          was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
          library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
          application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
          within our automation product.

          The CompTIA A+ certification requires that candidates pass two exams
          in professional IT troubleshooting for technical support roles.
          CompTIA A+ appears in more tech support job listings than any other IT
