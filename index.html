          I started collecting beads and making textiles when I was eight years
          old. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited
          internationally. Check out the <a href="https://j-kincaid.github.io/Open_studio/">site</a> I created for my art!

          During my 
          <a href="https://dimin.com/di-internship-program">internship</a> I worked with the Development, Design and Product teams to create a front end application for non-touch screens in Vue and Electron. The application features an image slider and API requests from DI's custom-built CMS. Two large screens display separate slideshows, permanently on view in Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall.

            Development Internship, Trivial, Inc., Winter 2022

        <p class="paragraph-right">
          During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
          the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
          was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
          library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
          <a href="https://www.withtrivial.com/">application</a>. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing within our automation product.
