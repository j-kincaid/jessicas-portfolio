        I started collecting beads and making textiles when I was eight years
        old. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited
        internationally. Check out the site I created for my art!

        Here I am at the unveiling reception for Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall! I coded the front end application
        for these non-touch screens in Vue and Electron, featuring an image slider and API requests from DI's
        custom-built CMS.

        Development Internship, <a href="https://www.withtrivial.com/">Trivial, Inc.</a>, 2022

      <p class="paragraph-right">
        During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
        the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
        was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
        library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
        application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
        within our automation product.
