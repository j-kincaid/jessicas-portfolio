          Here I am at the unveling reception for Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall! I coded the front end application for these non-touch screens in Vue and Electron, featuring an image slider and API requests from DI's custom-built CMS.

        <p class="paragraph-right">
          During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
          the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
          was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
          library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
          application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
          within our automation product.
