          I started collecting beads and making textiles when I was eight years
          old. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited
          internationally. Check out the site I created for my art!

          During my internship I worked with the Development, Design and Product teams to create a front end application for non-touch screens in Vue and Electron. The application features an image slider and API requests from DI's custom-built CMS. Two large screens display separate slideshows, permanently on view in Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall.

        <p class="paragraph-right">
          During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
          the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
          was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
          library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
          application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
          within our automation product.
