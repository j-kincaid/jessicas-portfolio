        When I was eight years old I started collecting beads and making textiles. I've earned a Masters in Fine Art, and my work has been exhibited internationally. Check out the site I created for my art!

        During my internship I worked with the development team to create the front end application for non-touch screens in Vue and Electron, featuring an image slider and API requests from DI's
        custom-built CMS. 
        Two large screens display separate slideshows, on view in Menorah Medical Center's Legacy Hall.

        Development Internship, <a href="https://www.withtrivial.com/">Trivial, Inc.</a>, 2022

      <p class="paragraph-right">
        During the Development Internship with Trivial I became acclimated to
        the Agile environment as part of a professional development team. This
        was my first remote startup role. I contributed to a JavaScript action
        library to integrate actions into the codebase of a RESTful
        application. I used the Postman API platform and Mocha for testing
        within our automation product.
